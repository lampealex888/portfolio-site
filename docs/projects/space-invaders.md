This project showcases my passion for game development, specifically through the creation of a Space Invaders game in Python. It represents a blend of my programming skills, creativity, and interest in retro arcade games.

## Technical Details

I structured the code using object-oriented principles, with separate classes for the player's spaceship, alien invaders, bullets, and game mechanics. Leveraging the Pygame library, I handled graphics, user input, and sound, streamlining the development process and allowing for a focus on gameplay logic. I implemented robust collision detection algorithms to ensure accurate interactions between bullets, the player's spaceship, and the alien invaders.
