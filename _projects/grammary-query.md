GrammarQuery was developed as a project for the University of Pittsburgh's [SheInnovates 2022 Hackathon](http://sheinnovates.us/). It serves as a voice-based language learning tool, prompting users with real-world questions to practice spoken English. The tool complements traditional language learning methods by focusing on conversational skills.

A live version of GrammarQuery can be found [here](https://nickzana.github.io/grammarquery/). Please note that the demo is currently inactive, but there are plans to recreate the project in a functional state this year.

Check out the [GrammarQuery Devpost submission](https://devpost.com/software/grammarquery) for additional details about the project, its development process, and the team behind it.

## Technical Details

The [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) is utilized for speech recognition, allowing GrammarQuery to convert spoken language into text and facilitate interactive language learning.

GrammarQuery integrates with the [GrammarBot API](https://www.grammarbot.io/) to analyze transcribed user responses. The API identifies grammar errors in the user's spoken English and presents them for learning purposes.

The source code for GrammarQuery is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/lampealex888/sheinnovates2022-grammar-query). Explore the repository to understand the implementation details or contribute to the project.

## Conclusion

GrammarQuery demonstrates the intersection of language learning and technology, offering a unique approach to improving conversational English skills. The combination of voice interaction, grammar analysis, and planned project improvements makes it an interesting tool for language enthusiasts and learners alike.
