Embark on a nostalgic journey with my _Space Invaders_ project, a tribute to the classic arcade era. Developed during my final project for my high school intermediate programming class, this game not only showcases my passion for game development but also represents a fusion of programming expertise, creativity, and a love for retro arcade experiences.

A live version of the game can be found [here](https://lampealex888.itch.io/space-invaders).

## Technical Details

The foundation of this project is built on sound object-oriented principles. The code is organized into distinct classes, each responsible for crucial game elements such as the player's spaceship, alien invaders, bullets, and overall game mechanics. This modular approach not only enhances code readability but also facilitates future updates and additions.

The heart of the game beats with the [PyGame](www.pygame.org) library. PyGame serves as the game development framework, providing a robust set of tools for handling graphics, user input, and sound. The library significantly streamlines the development process, allowing me to focus on implementing engaging gameplay mechanics.
 
For exporting the game for the web, I compiled the game to [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) utilizing the [Pygbag](https://pygame-web.github.io/) library, a popular WebAssembly converter for PyGame. PygBag empowers developers to create more than just desktop applications and package their game for the web, enhancing the overall user experience.

Explore the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/lampealex888/space-invaders/tree/main) to delve into the implementation details. Feel free to contribute, provide feedback, or use it as a learning resource for your own game development projects.

## Challenges

One of the key technical challenges was implementing precise collision detection algorithms. I ensured accurate interactions between bullets, the player's spaceship, and the alien invaders. This attention to detail contributes to the fluid and immersive gameplay experience.

## Conclusion

Space Invaders is more than a game; it's a testament to the enduring charm of retro arcade classics. The combination of Python, PyGame, and PygBag has resulted in a captivating gaming experience. Whether you're a seasoned gamer or new to the arcade scene, [play Space Invaders](https://lampealex888.itch.io/space-invaders) and enjoy the thrill of defeating relentless alien invaders!
